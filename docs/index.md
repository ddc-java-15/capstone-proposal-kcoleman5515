## Summary

This application will put individuals in connection with clubs in their schools and city. Using users and systems similar to LinkedIn, people can view profiles of individuals and their interests/acheivements. Furthermore, this will allow clubs themselves to find members for recruitment into clubs. This is intended to give direct connection between clubs and prospective members.

## Intended users


* As a highschool who enjoys extracurricular activities, I want an application that makes it easy to find clubs interested in the same things as me; in school or otherwise.

* As a young adult I'm looking for a place to stay connected to my hobbies with an application that allows solid communication with those who have similar interests.


## Client component

### Functionality

List the key functional aspects that will be provided by the user interface---i.e. tell us what the user will be able to do in the GUI.

### Persistent data

List the content that will be stored on the client side. This should include any information that a user of your system should expect to be maintained locally (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use, on a single device. 
    
### Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
    
## Server component

### Functionality

List the key functional aspects that will be provided by the server component---i.e. tell us what parts of the system functionality will be performed by the server.

### Persistent data

List the content that will be stored on the server side. This should include any information that a user of your system should expect to be accessible across multiple sessions of use, even if accessed from separate devices. In addition, if there will be data originating from some users that will then be accessible by other users, it should be part of the persistent data on the server. 
    
### External services

If the server component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. stock prices, Open Movie Database), those should also be listed here. Any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
    
## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
